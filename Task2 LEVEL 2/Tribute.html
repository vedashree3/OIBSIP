                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Western India's Maratha Empire was founded by Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He is regarded as one of the greatest fighters of his era, and even now, stories of his exploits are still spoken of as legends. 
                        Shivaji expelled a portion of the waning Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur with his courage and extraordinary administrative skills. Finally, it resulted in the founding of the Maratha Empire.
                        After establishing his standards, Shivaji carried out a smart and reasonable organisation with the aid of a restrained military and a well-established managerial structure. 
                        Shivaji is renowned for his innovative military tactics that rely on unconventional methods and use crucial factors like geology, speed, and shock to conquer his more exceptional opponents.</p>

                    <p>On February 19, 1630, Shivaji Bhosle was born to Shahaji Bhosle and Jijabai in the Shivneri stronghold, adjacent to the city of Junnar in the Pune region. Shivaji's father, Shahaji, was to serve as a commander for the Bijapuri Sultanate, a three-sided alliance comprising Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golconda.
                         Additionally, he owned a Jaigirdari, close to Pune. Jijabai, Shivaji's mother, was a fiercely austere woman and the young daughter of Sindkhed founder Lakhujirao Jadhav. Shivaji was extremely close to his mother, who gave him a strong sense of good and bad.</p>
                    <p>A small chamber of priests was tasked with overseeing Shivaji's education because Shahaji expended a significant amount of his energy outside of Pune. The panel was comprised of Peshwa (Shamrao Nilkanth), a Mazumdar (Balkrishna Pant), a Sabnis (Raghunath Ballal), 
                        a Dabir (Sonopant), and a principal instructor (Dadoji Konddeo). It was decided that Baji Pasalkar and Kanhoji Jedhe would train Shivaji in military and combative skills. In 1640, Shivaji married Saibai Nimbalkar.</p>
                    <p>Starting at a very young age, Shivaji became a born leader. Being an active outdoorsman, he explored the Sahayadri Mountains that encircled the Shivneri fortresses and learned pretty much everything there was to know. He had assembled a group of tenacious fighters from the Maval area when he was fifteen, 
                        and they later supported his early victories.</p>

            <div class="s-card"><img src="torna.png"><h3>Torna Fort</h3><p>The first feather on his royal crown, Torna was Shivaji’s premiere conquest at the young age of 16. Having rechristened it to Prachandgad, Shivaji Maharaj constructed monuments on its massive spread.</p></div>
            <div class="s-card"><img src="sinhagad.png"><h3>Sinhagad Fort</h3><p>After scaling a steep cliff and fighting a brutal battle against the Mughals, Tanaji Malusare lost his life. His brother took charge and won over the fort. Grieving this loss, Shivaji Maharaj remorsefully said, “Gad aala, pan Sinha gela” – We won the fort, but lost the lion. This explains the name and its importance in the pages of Maratha history.</p></div>
           <div class="s-card"><img src="raigad.png"><h3>Raigad Fort</h3><p>An epoch-making fort in the history of Maharashtra, Raigad was the capital of the Maratha Empire. It was here that the royal coronation of Shivaji Maharaj as the official king of the Maratha Empire took place. Although the fort was purloined and wrecked by the Britishers in 1818, much of its glory still remains. Shivaji Maharaj breathed his last in this fort.</p></div>
            <div class="s-card"><img src="shivneri.png"><h3>Shivneri Fort</h3><p>A 17th century fort, Shivneri is the birthplace of Shivaji Maharaj. The fort carries small temple of Goddess Shivai Devi after whom he was named.</p></div>

           <div class="s-card"><img src="rajgad.png"><h3>Rajgad Fort</h3><p>The erstwhile capital of the Maratha Empire, Shivaji Maharaj made many commandments and led history-defining moments from here.

            <div class="s-card"><img src="pratapgad.png"><h3>Pratapgad Fort</h3><p>Pratapgad is famous for the encounter between Shivaji and the mighty Afzal Khan.

                        <p>Shivaji Maharaj passed away at 52 on April 3, 1680, at the Raigad Fort, in the wake of experiencing an episode of looseness of the bowels. A contention of progression emerged after his passing between his oldest child Sambhaji and his third spouse Soyrabai for the benefit of her 10-year-old child Rajaram. Sambhaji ousted the youthful Rajaram and rose to the lofty position himself on June 20, 1680. 
                            The Mughal-Maratha clashes went on after Shivaji's passing, and the Maratha brilliance declined significantly. Anyway, it was recovered by youthful Madhavrao Peshwa, who recovered Maratha's greatness and laid out his position over North India.</p>
